In this Project I did for university I Used Transfer learning, deep learning and traditional machine learning. I then compared different dataset sizes on different types of models. I used; VGG16 and MobilenetV2 (transfer learning models), a Random Forest(Traditional ML), and a Convolutional Neural Network (deep learning). The data is processed in different ways so its compatible for each model type. Some other concepts like feature engineering and residual networks are included in the notebook. Data visualization and preparation are also included. I used The CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology. I didn't have to submit the notebook at university only a report and code snippets. so the code is a little messy in some places (import statements etc.. in places further down the notebook).
